Jerey had always been a fan of Olive Garden. The unlimited breadsticks, the hearty soups, the cozy ambianceâ€”it was his go-to spot for comfort food. One evening, after a particularly rough day at work, Jerey treated himself to a warm bowl of minestrone soup. As he settled into his favorite booth, the familiar aroma of Italian herbs and fresh bread enveloped him, providing a brief respite from his worries. The cheerful young waiter named Tony brought a steaming bowl of soup and a basket of breadsticks with a friendly smile.  Enjoy your meal, sir,  Tony said, giving Jerey a nod before walking away. Jerey savored the first few spoonfuls, letting the warmth spread through his body. But his spoon hit something solid as he dug deeper into the bowl. Puzzled, he fished around until he pulled up a small, furry object. His heart stopped as he realized he was staring at a severed rat  s foot, the tiny claws still intact. Disgust and anger surged through him. He stormed to the manager, demanding an explanation. The manager, pale and trembling, apologized profusely and assured Jerey that this had never happened before. They offered him a free meal, but Jerey was too horrified to accept. Determined to get justice, Jerey decided to sue Olive Garden. The news spread quickly, making headlines and causing a media frenzy. However, amidst the chaos, strange things began happening to Jerey. It started with scratching noises in his apartment. At first, he dismissed them as rodents in the walls, but the sounds grew louder and more persistent. Scratching, scurrying, and faint squeaks echoed through the night, robbing him of sleep. One night, as he lay in bed, exhausted but unable to sleep, he felt a sharp pain in his leg. He threw off the covers and found minor, bloody scratches on his skin as if tiny claws had raked across him. Panic set in, and he frantically searched his apartment for any sign of rats but found nothing. The following day, Jerey noticed something even more disturbing. His reflection in the bathroom mirror was off. His eyes seemed darker, almost hollow, and his skin had become sickly pallor. He shrugged it off as stress, but the feeling of being watched never left him. Days turned into weeks, and the haunting escalated. He would wake up to find rat footprints trailing across his kitchen counter, leading to his untouched food. His belongings were often rearranged as if tiny hands had been at work while he slept. He even heard indistinct and chilling whispers echoing through his apartment at night. Desperate for answers, Jerey delved into research about curses and hauntings. He discovered an old legend about the vengeful spirit of a rat king, a monstrous creature that sought revenge on those who wronged its kind. The legend spoke of a powerful curse that could befall anyone who disturbed the rat king  s descendants.Jerey realized with growing horror that his encounter at Olive Garden might have awakened something ancient and malevolent. He tried to make amends, leaving food offerings and setting up tiny altars, but nothing seemed to appease the spirit. One fateful night, as the scratching and whispers reached a deafening crescendo, Jerey found himself unable to move. He lay paralyzed in his bed, eyes wide with terror, as countless rats emerged from the shadows. They swarmed over him, their beady eyes glowing with an unnatural light. He felt their tiny claws digging into his flesh, their teeth gnawing at his skin. In the morning, Jerey was found lying lifeless in his bed, his body covered in hundreds of tiny scratches and bites. The authorities were baffled, unable to explain the cause of death. The case was quickly closed, chalked up to a freak accident. But those who knew the legend of the rat king whispered among themselves, knowing Jerey had become another victim of the rat  s revenge. And if you ever find yourself at Olive Garden, be sure to check your soup carefully. You never know what might be lurking beneath the surface, waiting for its chance to seek revenge.
